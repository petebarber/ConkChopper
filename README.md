# ConkChopper
Experimenting with image manipulation. Allows a section of an image to be chopped out. It simply consists of 2 views. The top view is a 1:1 scale of an image. This can be panned & zoomed. The vertical section displayed in this view is removed from the image. Effectively a top image is created from the remaining section above this view and a bottom image from below. These are then displayed in the view below.

Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the demo app:
